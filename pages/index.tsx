            I'm a computer scientist and software developer from Maracaibo, Venezuela.
            I graduated with honors from La Universidad del Zulia.
          </p>

          <p>
            I work as a full stack web developer, but most of my experience is with
            back-end development, databases and SQL.
          </p>

          <p>
            My academic interests are programming language theory, graph theory and
            discrete mathematics.
